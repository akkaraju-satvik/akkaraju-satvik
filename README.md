- ### [Restaurant Bill Generator using Vanilla JavaScript](https://www.github.com/akkaraju-satvik/restaurant-billing-js)

    A simple restaurant bill 📜 generator, works only when on live server, generates a .txt file containing the bill. Not a perfect project and has a few bugs 🐞, but it works just fine ✔. </p>
